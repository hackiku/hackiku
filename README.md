# Aerospace UX makes products fly ðŸ›¸

Building human-ish interfaces for the space industry. Previously a SaaS copywriter and UX designer, now focusing on thingies that fly.

```python
while not orbit:
    right_rudder()  # MOAR right rudder
```
Currently building:
- Pipewriter.io - wireframing app in Google Docs
- Jzro.co - product design for space startups
- Wingy - bake a parametric wing in composite materials
- 6pack Avionics - Arduino + mobile app for pilots (and cats)

## Tech Stack
Wingin' it (duh) until it clicks, with code, engineering software, and ignoring air resistance.

### Software
`Svelte` `TypeScript` `Three.js` `Python` `Streamlit` `React` `Prisma`

### Aero/Space
`OpenVSP` `Onshape API` `Xfoil` `Avionics`

## Need a spacey interface?
